Scenario :
system:SAP
Automatic Creation of Customer Invoice (from Logistics)
After the created billing is released to accounting, a respective accounts receivable invoice is automatically generated simultaneously. 
The billing document generated during this process creates two different documents:
1)A sales and distribution invoice (the bill)
2)An account receivable invoice
Let’s follow an example to see how this process is performed in the system. 
To display a billing document, you can use Transaction VF03 or the application menu path Logistics > Sales and Distribution > Billing > Billing Document > Display.
In the screen that appears, enter the billing document number, for example, “90000008”, and press the (Enter) key. You’ll arrive at the overview of the billing item, as shown below.
Now you can display the document flow to see the sales and distribution invoice and the accounting invoice. To do so, choose More
 • Environment > Display Document Flow.
 To open the accounts receivable invoice document, select Accounting Document 9400000001 in the listed document flow, and then click on the Display Document button.
In this example, this invoice isn’t cleared, as you can see in the Status field in the second figure above.
The corresponding SAP Fiori app is called Display Billing Documents (F2250). It's visually and functionally the same as the SAP GUI transaction. However, there is a beautiful new app called Display Document Flow (F3665) for visualizing the document flow
