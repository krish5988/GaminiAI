\\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n5 \\n LEVEL 1 : STORI ES FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN  \\nTHE WIND AND THE SUN  \\n \\nOnce the Wind and the Sun had an argument. “I am stronger than you,” said the Wind. “No, \\nyou are not,” said the Sun. Just at that moment they saw a traveler walking across the road. \\nHe was wrapped in a s hawl. The Sun and the Wind agreed that whoever could separate the \\ntraveller from his shawl was stronger.  \\nThe Wind took the first turn. He blew with all his might to tear the traveller’s shawl from his \\nshoulders. But the harder he blew, the tighter the trav eller gripped the shawl to his body. \\nThe struggle went on till the Wind’s turn was over.  \\nNow it was the Sun’s turn. The Sun smiled warmly. The traveller felt the warmth of the \\nsmiling Sun. Soon he let the shawl fall open. The Sun’s smile grew warmer and wa rmer... \\nhotter and hotter. Now the traveller no longer needed his shawl. He took it off and dropped \\nit on the ground. The Sun was declared stronger than the Wind.  \\n \\nMoral: Brute force can’t achieve what a gentle smile can.  \\n  \\nTHE VILLAGER AND THE SPECTACLES  \\n \\nThere was a villager. He was illiterate. He did not know how to read and write. He often saw \\npeople wearing spectacles for reading books or papers. He thought, “If I have spectacles, I \\ncan also read like these people. I must go to town and buy a pair of spectacles for myself.”  \\nSo one day he went to a town. He entered a spectacles shop He asked the shopkeeper for a \\npair of spectacles for reading. The shopkeeper gave him various pairs of spectacles and a \\nbook. The villager tried all the spectacles one by on e. But he could not read anything. He \\ntold the shopkeeper that all those spectacles were useless for him. The shopkeeper gave \\nhim a doubtful look. Then he looked at the book. It was upside down! The shopkeeper said, \\n“Perhaps you don’t know how to read.”  \\nThe villager said, “No, I don’t. I want to buy spectacles so that I can read like others. But I \\ncan’t read with any of these spectacles.” The shopkeeper controlled his laughter with great \\ndifficulty when he learnt the real problem of his illiterate customer.  \\nHe explained to the villager, “My dear friend, you are very ignorant. Spectacles don’t help to \\nread or write. They only help you to see better. First of all you must learn to read and \\nwrite.”  \\n \\nMoral: Ignorance is blindness.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n6 \\n   \\nAS YOU SOW, SO SHALL Y OU REAP  \\n \\nOne night, three thieves stole a lot of money from a rich man’s house. They put the money \\nin a bag and went to the forest. They felt very hungry. So, one of them went to a nearby \\nvillage to buy food. The other two remained in the forest to take ca re of the bag of money.  \\nThe thief that went for food had an evil idea. He ate his food at a hotel. Then he bought \\nfood for his two mates in the forest. He mixed a strong poison with the food. He thought, \\n“Those two will eat this poisoned food and die. Then  I will get all the money for myself.”  \\nMeanwhile, the two wicked men in the forest decided to kill their mate on return. They \\nthought that they would divide the money between the two of them. All the three wicked \\nmen carried out their cruel plans. The thie f who wanted all the money for himself came to \\nthe forest with the poisoned food. The two men in the forest hit him and killed him. Then \\nthey ate the poisoned food and died.  \\nThus, these evil people met with an evil end.  \\n \\nMoral: Evil begets evil  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nTHE F ARMER AND HIS SONS  \\n \\nA farmer had five sons. They were strong and hardworking. But they always quarrelled with \\none another. Sometimes, they even fought. The farmer wanted his sons to stop quarrelling \\nand fighting. He wanted them to live in peace. Plain word s of advice or scolding did not have \\nmuch effect on these young people.  \\nThe farmer always thought what to do to keep his sons united. One day he found an answer \\nto the problem. So he called all his sons together. He showed them a bundle of sticks and \\nsaid,  “I want any of you to break these sticks without separating them from the bundle.”  \\nEach of the five sons tried one by one. They used their full strength and skill. But none of \\nthem could break the sticks. Then the old man separated the sticks and gave eac h of them \\njust a single stick to break. They broke the sticks easily.  \\nThe farmer said, “A single stick by itself is weak. It is strong as long as it is tied up in a \\nbundle. Likewise, you will be strong if you are united. You will be weak if you are divided .” \\n \\nMoral: United we stand, Divided we fall.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n7 \\n BIRBAL THE WISE  \\n \\nOne day, a rich merchant came to Birbal. He said to Birbal, “I have seven servants in my \\nhouse. One of them has stolen my bag of precious pearls. Please find out the thief.”  \\nSo Birbal went to the rich man’s house. He called all the seven servants in a room. He gave a \\nstick to each one of them. Then he said, “These are magic sticks. Just now all these sticks are \\nequal in length. Keep them with you and return tomorrow. If there is a thief  in the house, \\nhis stick will grow an inch longer by tomorrow.”  \\nThe servant who had stolen the bag of pearls was scared. He thought, “If I cut a piece of one \\ninch from my stick, I won’t be caught.” So he cut the stick and made it shorter by one inch.  \\nThe n ext day Birbal collected the sticks from the servants. He found that one servant’s stick \\nwas short by an inch. Birbal pointed his finger at him and said, “Here is the thief.” The \\nservant confessed to his crime. He returned the bag of pearls. He was sent to  jail. \\n   \\nTHE WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING  \\nOne day a wolf found a sheepskin. He covered himself with the sheepskin and got into a \\nflock of sheep grazing in a field. He thought, “The shepherd will shut the sheep in the pen \\nafter sunset. At night I will run away  with a fat sheep and eat it.  \\nAll went well till the shepherd shut the sheep in the pen and left. The wolf waited patiently \\nfor the night to advance and grow darker. But then an unexpected thing happened. One of \\nthe servants of the shepherd entered the pen . His master had sent him to bring a fat sheep \\nfor supper. As luck would have it, the servant picked up the wolf dressed in the sheepskin.  \\nThat night the shepherd and his guests had the wolf for supper.  \\nMoral: An evil design has an evil end.  \\n \\nHARE AND THE TORTOISE  \\nOnce a hare was roaming near a lake in a forest. Suddenly he saw a tortoise and mocked at \\nhim saying - \"Hurry up, you slow coach! Don\\'t you find life very dull taking so long to cover \\na few yards? I could have run to the other side of the lake by now.\"  \\nThe tortoise felt teased and dared the hare to a race. The race was to be through the wood \\nto a fixed goal.  \\nThe hare agreed laughingly. In a few minutes he was away and out of sight.  \\n\"What a funny race it is!\" he said to himself , \"I am already half -way through.  But it is too -\\ntoo cold; why not have a nap in the warm sunshine?\"  \\nThe tortoise walked steadily on and on. In a short time, he passed by the sleeping hare.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n8 \\n The hare slept   far longer then he had intended.When he woke up at last, he looked \\narou nd in surprise and said to himself,\" Not even a sigh of the poor tortoise anywhere so \\nfar; I had better trot along and finish the race.\"  \\nThe hare ran to the goal. He was amazed to see all the animals cheering the tortoise who \\nhad arrived just a minute earl ier. how ashamed he felt indeed!  \\nMoral: Slow and steady wins the race  \\nNOBODY BELIEVES A LIAR  \\nOnce a mischievous boy lived in a village that stood in the feet of a hill. One day he thought \\nof having fun at the cost of his fellow -villagers.  \\n \\nStanding on a hi gh rock, he shouted at the top of his voice, \"Lion! Lion! Come, save me.\"  \\n \\nThe villagers heard the shout and ran to help him. But when they reached there, they could \\nsee no lion and the boy was perfectly all right. The boy laughed at the villagers saying, \"No \\nLion ; I did it only for fun.\"  \\n \\nThe villagers got highly annoyed and came back with an air of anger.   \\n \\nFew days later the boy repeated the whole act. Again the villagers went to his rescue but \\nwere duped again. Now they decided not to be fooled by him anymore.  \\n \\nUnfortunately, one day, the lion really came there. Now the boy shouted,  \"Lion! Lion! as \\nloud as he could\". But nobody came to help him out.  \\n \\nThe lion attacked the boy. The boy struggled hard to save himself but within few minutes, \\nthe beast kill ed him.  \\n \\nSo, once a liar, always a liar.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n9 \\n WORK IS WORSHIP  \\nOne fine sunny day in winter, a grasshopper was basking in the warm sun. But he was very \\nhungry, as he had not eaten anything since last night.   \\n \\nSo, he looked about to find something to soothe his hunger. Suddenly, he saw few ants \\ncarrying grains into their hole.  \\n \\nHe went up to the ants and asked humbly, \"Can you, please, spare few grains for me. I \\nhaven\\'t eaten anything since yesterday. So, I am almost starving to death.\"  \\n \\nOne of the ants asked the  grasshopper, \"What were you doing the whole summer? Why \\ndidn\\'t you store up the food for the winter season?\"  \\n \\nThe grasshopper replied, \"Truly speaking, I spent all the summer singing songs and that\\'s \\nwhy I couldn\\'t store anything.\"  \\n \\nThe ant chucked out a smile and remarked, \"Then dance the winter away.\" The grasshopper \\npulled a long face and walked away.  \\n \\nSo we say \"Work is real worship\".  \\n \\nNEVER BE UNGRATEFUL  \\n \\nIt was high summer. The sun was extremely hot. Two travelers were going along a dusty \\nroad that had no trees along its sides. Looking for some shelter from the hot sun, they saw a \\ntree with big leaves and branches spread like an umbrella.   \\n \\nThey placed their b elongings on the ground and sat in the cool thick shade of the tree. After \\ntaking some rest, one traveler said to the other, \"What a useless tree it is! It bears no fruits \\nat all.\"  \\n \\nHearing this, the tree felt pinched and burst out, \"You ungrateful soul! O n one hand, you are \\ntaking shelter in my cool shade from the burning heat of the sun and on the other hand, you \\nare calling me useless. Get up and leave the place immediately to be scorched again.\"  \\n \\n  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n10 \\n KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN  \\n \\nOnce upon a time there was a lion that grew so old that he was unable to kill any prey for \\nhis foo d. So, he said to himself, \"I must do something to stay my stomach else I will die of \\nstarvation.\"  \\n \\nHe kept thinking and thinking and at last an idea clicked him. He decided to lie down in the \\ncave pretending to be ill and then who -so-ever will come to enq uire about his health, will \\nbecome his prey. The old lion put his wicked plan into practice and it started working. Many \\nof his well -wishers got killed. But evil is short lived.  \\n \\nOne day, a fox came to visit the ailing lion. As foxes are clever by nature, the fox stood at the \\nmouth of the cave and looked about. His sixth sense worked and he came to know the \\nreality. So, he called out to the lion from outside and said, \"How are you, sir?\"  \\n \\nThe lion replied, \"I am not feeling well at all. But why don\\'t you co me inside?\"  \\n \\nThen the fox replied, \"I would love to come in, sir! But on seeing, all foot prints going to your \\ncave and none coming out, I would be foolish enough to come in.\"  \\n \\nSaying so, the fox went to alert the other animals.  \\n \\n \\nLIVE AND LET LIVE  \\n \\nOnce there was a big pool near a  village. The villagers used the water of the pool for \\ndrinking and for other purposes also. The pool was abounded with fish.  \\n \\nOnce a fisherman went fishing to the pool. He cast his net into the pool and sat down. But \\nhe was very impatient. So, he tied a l ong string to a small stone. Then putting it into the \\npool, he began to stir the water to drive more fish into his net.  \\n \\nA villager saw him do so and asked him not to make the water muddy. But the fisherman \\ndidn\\'t listen to him and went on beating the wate r and making it dirty. So, the villagers \\nbrought some companions armed with weapons. Seeing them, the fisherman got scared. He \\ndrew out his stone and apologized.\"  \\n  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n11 \\n TIME IS VALUABLE  \\n \\nAnthony was a very lazy boy and always used to postpone things. One day hi s father called \\nhim and made him understand the value of time that one should always do things on time. \\nAnthony promised his father that he would never postpone things.  \\n \\nOne day, he came to know that he had won the first prize in a singing competition that  was \\nheld the previous month. He was asked to collect the prize the same day. He didn\\'t care and \\nwent to collect the prize the next day. But the prize became useless for him, as it was a \\nticket to a circus show, which was held the previous day.   \\n \\nAnthony l earnt a lesson from this incident.  \\n \\nHAVE FAITH IN GOD  \\n \\nOnce a teacher had a disciple who used to live in a hermitage. One day, the disciple was \\ngoing somewhere. He hadn\\'t gone too far when suddenly it started raining cats and dogs. He \\nreturned and told thi s problem to his teacher. The teacher said, \"You should have faith in \\ngod. He will save you from all problems.\"  \\n \\nThe disciple obeyed and resumed his journey. He kept reciting the name of god and cleared \\nall the hurdles.   \\n \\nNext day, the teacher had to go on  the same route. When he reached a deep drain, he \\ndoubted whether god would save him or not. The teacher got drowned.  \\n \\nThus, doubt drowns you and faith saves you.  \\nBLIND IMITATION IS BAD  \\n \\nOne day, a saint while going somewhere with his disciples saw a pond full of fishes, on the \\nway. He stopped there and started filling his mouth with fish. The disciples followed their \\nguru. The saint said nothing to them and after some time moved ahead.  \\n \\nThen they reached another pond, where there were no fishes. The saint stood at its shore \\nand started taking out the fishes he had swallowed. When the disciples saw this, they were  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n12 \\n amazed and also tried to vomit out the fishes, but after many attempts, they could only take \\nout some dead fishes.  \\n \\nAt this, the saint said, \"Fool s, when you didn\\'t know how to keep the fishes alive in the \\nstomach, then why did you imitate me?\"  \\n \\nIts truly said that never imitate anyone.  \\n \\nA FOX AND A CRANE  \\n \\nOnce a fox and a crane became friends. So, the fox invited the crane to dinner. The crane \\nacce pted the invitation and reached the fox\\'s place at sunset.  \\n \\nThe fox had prepared soup for his mate. But as we all know that foxes are cunning by \\nnature, he served the soup in flat dishes. So, he himself lapped the crane\\'s share with his \\ntongue enjoying its  relish a lot. But the crane could not enjoy it at all with his long beak and \\nhad to get back home hungry. The shrewd fox felt extremely amused.  \\n \\nAfter few days, the crane invited the fox to dine in with him. The fox reached his place well \\nin time. The cra ne gave him a warm welcome and served the soup in a jug with a long and \\nnarrow neck.  \\n \\nSo, the crane enjoyed the soup with great relish using his long beak. The fox\\'s mouth \\ncouldn\\'t reach the soup through the narrow neck of the jug. He had to return home hu ngry. \\nNow he realized that he had been repaid for his behaviour with the crane.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n13 \\n LAUGHTER IS THE BEST MEDICINE  \\n \\nOnce there lived a grumpy king. He never used to laugh nor allow anyone in the kingdom to \\nlaugh.  \\n \\nOne day, a small boy couldn\\'t control his  laughter. Later, scared of the punishment, he \\nthought of a plan. He wrote a funny story and converted it into a drama.   \\n \\nThen he went to the palace and asked the king, \"May I present my drama to you?\" the king \\nlet him do it. Then the boy started the play.  In the end, he came to the funniest part of the \\nstory which made the king laugh.   \\n \\nAll people present in the court were amazed. The king then allowed everybody to laugh. \\nEveryone then lived happily thereafter.  \\n  \\nTHE STORY OF LORD GANESHA  \\nOne day, Goddess Parvathi, the wife of Lord Shiva, was getting ready for her bath and \\nneeded someone to guard her chamber. Therefore she made a beautiful, young boy from \\nthe sandalwood from her body. She gave him life by sprinkling the Holy Ganges water on \\nhim and entruste d him with guarding the door.  \\nWhile she was away, Lord Shiva returned and was surprised to find a little boy standing at \\nthe entrance to his wife’s chamber. When he tried to enter, the boy blocked his path. “Who \\nare you and why are you blocking my path?” d emanded Lord Shiva. “No one enters my \\nmother’s chamber”, declared the boy boldly. Taken aback, Lord Shiva replied, “Step away; I \\nhave the right to enter my wife’s chamber.” But the young and courageous boy did not \\nmove but stood his ground. Not knowing tha t this was his own son, Lord Shiva who was \\nquick to anger grew enraged. Not used to be disobeyed he cut off the boy’s head.  \\nGoddess Parvathi on returning from her bath saw her son lying dead and was overcome \\nwith grief. She was filled with both anger and s orrow. Seeing this Lord Shiva sent his soldiers \\nto fetch the head of the first beast that they saw. The men rushed and finally came upon an \\nelephant. They immediately took the head to Lord Shiva, who quickly attached it onto the \\nbody of the slain boy and g ave him life once again.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n14 \\n To further appease his grief -stricken wife he promised that her son would be worshipped \\nfirst, before all other Gods.  \\nEven today at the entrance of all temples one would find the idol of the elephant -headed \\nGod, Lord Ganesha.  \\n \\nEAGL ES IN A STORM  \\nDid you know that an eagle knows when a storm is approaching long before it breaks? The \\neagle will fly to some high spot and wait for the winds to come. When the storm hits, it sets \\nits wings so that the wind will pick it up and lift it above  the storm. While the storm rages \\nbelow, the eagle is soaring above it.The eagle does not escape the storm. It simply uses the \\nstorm to lift it higher. It rises on the winds that bring the storm.When the storms of life \\ncome upon us – and all of us will exp erience them – we can rise above them by setting our \\nminds and our belief toward God. The storms do not have to overcome us.

Eighteen! In order merely to keep food on the table for this mob, the father and \\nhead of the household, a goldsmith by profession, worked almo st eighteen hours a day at \\nhis trade and any other paying chore he could find in the neighborhood. Despite their \\nseemingly hopeless condition, two of Albrecht Durer the Elder’s children had a dream. They \\nboth wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they  knew full well that their father would \\nnever be financially able to send either of them to Nuremberg to study at the \\nAcademy.After many long discussions at night in their crowded bed, the two boys finally \\nworked out a pact. They would toss a coin. The los er would go down into the nearby mines \\nand, with his earnings, support his brother while he attended the academy. Then, when that \\nbrother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n19 \\n brother at the academy, either with sales of his artwork or, if necessary, also by laboring in \\nthe mines.They tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won the \\ntoss and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the \\nnext four years, finance d his brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate \\nsensation. Albrecht’s etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than those of most \\nof his professors, and by the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees \\nfor h is commissioned works.When the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family \\nheld a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate Albrecht’s triumphant homecoming. After a \\nlong and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, Albrecht rose from  his \\nhonored position at the head of the table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the \\nyears of sacrifice that had enabled Albrecht to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, \\n“And now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn. Now  you can go to \\nNuremberg to pursue your dream, and I will take care of you.”All heads turned in eager \\nexpectation to the far end of the table where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, \\nshaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed a nd repeated, over and over, \\n“No …no …no …no.”  \\nFinally, Albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at \\nthe faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, “No, \\nbrother. I cannot go to  Nuremberg. It is too late for me. Look … looks what four years in the \\nmines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, \\nand lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even \\nhold  a glass to return your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with \\na pen or a brush. No, brother … for me it is too late.”  \\nMore than 450 years have passed. By now, Albrecht Durer’s hundreds of masterful portraits, \\npen and silver -point  sketches, watercolors, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings \\nhang in every great museum in the world, but the odds are great that you, like most people, \\nare familiar with only one of Albrecht Durer’s works. More than merely being familiar with \\nit, yo u very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office.  \\nOne day, to pay homage to Albert for all that he had sacrificed, Albrecht Durer painstakingly \\ndrew his brother’s abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He \\ncalled his powerful drawing simply “Hands,” but the entire world almost immediately \\nopened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love “The Praying \\nHands.”   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n20 \\n The next time you see a copy of that touching creation, take a second look.

He loved the 4t h wife the most and adorned \\nher with rich robes and treated her to delicacies. He took great care of her and gave her \\nnothing but the best.  \\nHe also loved the 3rd wife very much. He’s very proud of her and always wanted to show off \\nher to his friends. Howev er, the merchant is always in great fear that she might run away \\nwith some other men.  \\nHe too, loved his 2nd wife. She is a very considerate person, always patient and in fact is the \\nmerchant’s confidante. Whenever the merchant faced some problems, he alway s turned to \\nhis 2nd wife and she would always help him out and tide him through difficult times.  \\nNow, the merchant’s 1st wife is a very loyal partner and has made great contributions in \\nmaintaining his wealth and business as well as taking care of the hous ehold. However, the \\nmerchant did not love the first wife and although she loved him deeply, he hardly took \\nnotice of her.  \\nOne day, the merchant fell ill. Before long, he knew that he was going to die soon. He \\nthought of his luxurious life and told himself,  “Now I have 4 wives with me. But when I die, \\nI’ll be alone. How lonely I’ll be!”  \\nThus, he asked the 4th wife, “I loved you most, endowed you with the finest clothing and \\nshowered great care over you. Now that I’m dying, will you follow me and keep me \\ncomp any?” “No way!” replied the 4th wife and she walked away without another word.  \\nThe answer cut like a sharp knife right into the merchant’s heart. The sad merchant then \\nasked the 3rd wife, “I have loved you so much for all my life. Now that I’m dying, will you \\nfollow me and keep me company?” “No!” replied the 3rd wife. “Life is so good over here! \\nI’m going to remarry when you die!” The merchant’s heart sank and turned cold.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n21 \\n He then asked the 2nd wife, “I always turned to you for help and you’ve always helped  me \\nout. Now I need your help again. When I die, will you follow me and keep me company?” \\n“I’m sorry, I can’t help you out this time!” replied the 2nd wife. “At the very most, I can only \\nsend you to your grave.” The answer came like a bolt of thunder and t he merchant was \\ndevastated.  \\nThen a voice called out: “I’ll leave with you. I’ll follow you no matter where you go.” The \\nmerchant looked up and there was his first wife. She was so skinny, almost like she suffered \\nfrom malnutrition. Greatly grieved, the mer chant said, “I should have taken much better \\ncare of you while I could have!”  \\nActually, we all have 4 wives in our lives  \\na. The 4th wife is our body. No matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look \\ngood, it’ll leave us when we die.  \\nb. Our 3r d wife? Our possessions, status and wealth. When we die, they all go to others.  \\nc. The 2nd wife is our family and friends. No matter how close they had been there for us \\nwhen we’re alive, the furthest they can stay by us is up to the grave.  \\nd. The 1st wife  is in fact our soul, often neglected in our pursuit of material, wealth and \\nsensual pleasure.  \\nGuess what? It is actually the only thing that follows us wherever we go. Perhaps it’s a good \\nidea to cultivate and strengthen it now rather than to wait until w e’re on our deathbed to \\nlament  \\n \\nWAIT FOR THE BRICK  \\nA young and successful executive was traveling down a neighborhood street, going a bit too \\nfast in his new Jaguar. He was watching for kids darting out from between parked cars and \\nslowed down when he thou ght he saw something. As his car passed, no children appeared. \\nInstead, a brick smashed into the Jag’s side door! He slammed on the brakes and drove the \\nJag back to the spot where the brick had been thrown. The angry driver then jumped out of \\nthe car, grab bed the nearest kid and pushed him up against a parked car, shouting, “What \\nwas that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing?   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n22 \\n That’s a new car and that brick you threw is going to cost a lot of money. Why did you do \\nit?” \\nThe young boy w as apologetic. “Please mister … please, I’m sorry… I didn’t know what else \\nto do,” he pleaded. “I threw the brick because no one else would stop…”  \\nWith tears dripping down his face and off his chin, the youth pointed to a spot just around a \\nparked car. “It ’s my brother,” he said. “He rolled off the curb and fell out of his wheelchair \\nand I can’t lift him up.”  \\nNow sobbing, the boy asked the stunned executive, “Would you please help me get him \\nback into his wheelchair? He’s hurt and he’s too heavy for me.” Mo ved beyond words, the \\ndriver tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. He hurriedly lifted the \\nhandicapped boy back into the wheelchair, then took out his fancy handkerchief and \\ndabbed at the fresh scrapes and cuts. A quick look told him ev erything was going to be okay.  \\n“Thank you and may God bless you,” the grateful child told the stranger. Too shook up for \\nwords, the man simply watched the little boy push his wheelchair -bound brother down the \\nsidewalk toward their home. It was a long, slow  walk back to the Jaguar. The damage was \\nvery noticeable, but the driver never bothered to repair the dented side door. He kept the \\ndent there to remind him of this message: Don’t go through life so fast that someone has to \\nthrow a brick at you to get your  attention!  \\nGod whispers in our souls and speaks to our hearts. Sometimes when we don’t have time to \\nlisten, He has to throw a brick at us.  \\nIt’s our choice: Listen to the whisper … or wait for the brick!  \\n \\nPUPPIES FOR SALE  \\nA farmer had some puppies he neede d to sell. He painted a sign advertising the pups and \\nset about nailing it to a post on the edge of his yard. As he was driving the last nail into the \\npost, he felt a tug on his overalls. He looked down into the Eyes of a little boy. Mister,” he \\nsaid, “I w ant to buy one of your puppies.”  \\n“Well,” said the farmer, as he rubbed the sweat off the back of his neck, “these puppies \\ncome from fine parents and cost a good deal of money.” The boy dropped his head for a  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n23 \\n moment. Then reaching deep into his pocket, he p ulled out a handful of change and held it \\nup to the farmer. “I’ve got thirty -nine cents. Is that enough to take a look?” “Sure,” said the \\nfarmer.  \\nAnd with that he let out a whistle, “Here, Dolly!” he called.  \\nOut from the doghouse and down the ramp ran Doll y followed by four little balls of fur. The \\nlittle boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.  \\nAs the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed something else stirring inside \\nthe doghouse. Slowly another little ball appeared; this One noticeably smaller. Down the \\nramp it slid. Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling toward the \\nothers, doing its best to catch up…. “I want that one,” the little boy said, pointing to the \\nrunt.  \\nThe farm er knelt down at the boy’s side and said, “Son, you don’t want that puppy. He will \\nnever be able to run and play with you like these other dogs would.” With that the little boy \\nstepped back from the fence, reached down, and began rolling up one leg of his trousers. In \\ndoing so he revealed a steel brace running down both sides of his leg attaching itself to a \\nspecially made shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he said, “You see sir, I don’t run too \\nwell myself, and he will need someone who understands.”  \\nThe world is full of people who need someone who understands.  \\n \\nTHE MAN, THE BOY AND THE DONKEY  \\nA Man and his son were once going with their Donkey to market. As they were walking \\nalong by its side a countryman passed them and said: \"You fools, what is a Donkey for but to \\nride upon?\"  \\nSo the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way. But soon they passed a \\ngroup of men, one of whom said: \"See that lazy youngster, he lets his father walk while he \\nrides.\"  \\nSo the Man ordered his Boy to get off, and got  on himself. But they hadn\\'t gone far when \\nthey passed two women, one of whom said to the other: \"Shame on that lazy lout to let his \\npoor little son trudge along.\"   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n24 \\n Well, the Man didn\\'t know what to do, but at last he took his Boy up before him on the \\nDonke y. By this time they had come to the town, and the passers -by began to jeer and point \\nat them. The Man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at. The men said:  \\n\"Aren\\'t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours and your hulking \\nson?\" \\nThe Man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do. They thought and they thought, till \\nat last they cut down a pole, tied the donkey\\'s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey \\nto their shoulders. They went along amid the laughter of all who m et them till they came to \\nMarket Bridge, when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the \\nBoy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle the Donkey fell over the bridge, and his fore -\\nfeet being tied together he was drowned.  \\n\"That  will teach you,\" said an old man who had followed them:  \\nPlease all, and you will please none  \\n \\nTHE WOODEN BOWL  \\nA frail old man went to live with his son, daughter -in-law, and a four -year old grandson. The \\nold man\\'s hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred,  and his step faltered. The family ate \\ntogether nightly at the dinner table. But the elderly grandfather\\'s shaky hands and failing \\nsight made eating rather difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped \\nthe glass often milk spilled on  the tablecloth. The son and daughter -in-law became irritated \\nwith the mess. \"We must do something about grandfather,\" said the son. I\\'ve had enough of \\nhis spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor. So the husband and wife set a small \\ntable in the corner. There, grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner \\nat the dinner table. Since grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a \\nwooden bowl. Sometimes when the family glanced in grandfather\\'s direction, he had a t ear \\nin his eye as he ate alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp \\nadmonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four -year -old watched it all in \\nsilence.  \\nOne evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood  scraps on the \\nfloor. He asked the child sweetly, \"What are you making?\" Just as sweetly, the boy \\nresponded, \"Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and mama to eat your food from when I \\ngrow up.\" The four -year -old smiled and went back to work. The words so  struck the parents \\nthat they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word \\nwas spoken, both knew what must be done. That evening the husband took grandfather\\'s \\nhand and gently led him back to the family table.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n25 \\n For the rem ainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, \\nneither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, \\nor the tablecloth soiled. Children are remarkably perceptive. Their eyes ever observe, thei r \\nears ever listen, and their minds ever process the messages they absorb. If they see us \\npatiently provide a happy home atmosphere for family members, they will imitate that \\nattitude for the rest of their lives.

They were dis cussing their hopes and \\ndreams when the first tree said, \"Someday I hope to be a treasure chest. I could be filled \\nwith gold, silver and precious gems. I could be decorated with intricate carving and \\neveryone would see the beauty.\"  \\nThen the second tree sai d, \"Someday I will be a mighty ship. I will take kings and queens \\nacross the waters and sail to the corners of the world. Everyone will feel safe in me becau se \\nof the strength of my hull.\"  \\nFinally the third tree said, \"I want to grow to be the tallest and straightest tree in the forest. \\nPeople will see me on top of the hill and look up to my branches, and think of the heavens \\nand God and how close to them I am reaching. I will be the greatest tree of all time and \\npeople will always remember me.\"  \\nAfter a few  years of praying that their dreams would come true, a group of woodsmen came \\nupon the trees. When one came to the first tree he said, \"This looks like a strong tree, I think \\nI should be able to sell the wood to a carpenter\" ... and he began cutting it dow n. The tree \\nwas happy, because he knew that the carpenter would make him into a treasure chest.  \\nAt the second tree a woodsman said, \"This looks like a strong tree, I should be able to sell it \\nto the shipyard.\" The second tree was happy because he knew he w as on his way to \\nbecoming a mighty ship.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n26 \\n When the woodsmen came upon the third tree, the tree was frightened because he knew \\nthat if they cut him down his dreams would not come true. One of the woodsmen said, \"I \\ndon\\'t need anything special from my tree so I\\'ll take  this one\", and he cut it down.  \\nWhen the first tree arrived at the carpenters, he was made into a feed box for animals. He \\nwas then placed in a barn and filled with hay. This was not at all what he had prayed for. The \\nsecond tree was cut and made into a small fishing boat. His dreams of being a mighty ship \\nand carrying kings had come to an end. The third tree was cut into large pieces and left \\nalone in the dark. The years went by, and the trees forgot about their dreams.  \\nThen one day, a man and wom an came to the barn. She gave birth and they placed the baby \\nin the hay in the feed box that was made from the first tree. The man wished that he could \\nhave made a crib for the baby, but this manger would have to do. The tree could feel the \\nimportance of t his event and knew that it had held the greatest treasure of all time. Years \\nlater, a group of men got in the fishing boat made from the second tree. One of them was \\ntired and went to sleep. While they were out on the water, a great storm arose and the tre e \\ndidn\\'t think it was strong enough to keep the men safe. The men woke the sleeping man, \\nand he stood and said \"Peace\" and the storm stopped. At this time, the tree knew that it \\nhad carried the King of Kings in its boat.  \\nFinally, someone came and got the t hird tree. It was carried through the streets as the \\npeople mocked the man who was carrying it. When they came to a stop, the man was nailed \\nto the tree and raised in the air to die at the top of a hill. When Sunday came, the tree came \\nto realize that it w as strong enough to stand at the top of the hill and be as close to God as \\nwas possible, because Jesus had been crucified on it.  \\nThe moral of this story is that when things don\\'t seem to be going your way, always know \\nthat God has a plan for you. If you pl ace your trust in Him, He will give you great gifts. Each \\nof the trees got what they wanted, just not in the way they had imagined. We don\\'t always \\nknow what God\\'s plans are for us. We just know that His ways are not our ways, but His \\nways are always best.  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n27 \\n  \\nPENCIL  \\nThe Pencil Maker took the pencil aside, just before putting him into the box.  \\n\"There are 5 things you need to know,\" he told the pencil, \"Before I send you out into the \\nworld.

Finally, on the morning of his graduation, his father called  him into his private \\nstudy.  His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how \\nmuch he loved him. He handed his son a beautifully wrapped gift box.  Curious, but \\nsomewhat disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely, leather -bound \\nBible, with the young man\\'s name embossed in gold. Angry, he raised his voice to his father \\nand said \"With all your money, you give me a Bible?\" and stormed out of the house, leaving \\nthe Bible.  \\nMany years passed and the young man was very successful in business. He had a beautiful \\nhome and  wonderful family, but realized his father was very old, and thought perhaps he \\nshould go  to  him.  He had not seen him since that graduation day.  Before he could make \\narrangements, he received a telegram telling him his fathe r had passed away, and willed all \\nof his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately and take care of things.  \\nWhen he arrived at his father\\'s house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart.  He began \\nto search through his father\\'s importa nt papers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had \\nleft it  years ago.  With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn the pages.  And as he \\ndid, a car key dropped from the back of the Bible.  It had a tag with the dealer\\'s name, the \\nsame dealer who had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his \\ngraduation, and the words PAID IN FULL.  \\nHow many times do we miss Spirit\\'s blessings and answers to our prayers  because they do \\nnot arrive exactly as we have expected?   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n29 \\n  \\nTHE GREEDY CLO UD \\nOnce upon a time lived on a cloud that was grown up over a very beautiful country. One \\nday, she saw another much bigger cloud and she felt so much envy, than the cloud decided \\nthat in order to get bigger and grow more, her water would never abandon her,  and will \\nnever start raining again.  \\nIndeed, the cloud grew up, while his country was getting dried. First, rivers dried up, then \\npeople, animals, plants, and finally, the whole country became a desert. The cloud did not \\ncare much, but she also did not rea lize that by being over a desert there was no place where \\nshe could obtain new water to keep growing. So slowly, the cloud began to lose size, and \\nwas unable to do anything to stop it .  \\nThe cloud then realized her mistake, and that her greed and selfishnes s were the cause of \\nher vanishing; but just before evaporating, when she was just a sigh of cotton, there started \\nblowing a gentle breeze. The cloud was so small and weighed so little that the wind took her \\nfar away, to a faraway beautiful country, where o nce again she recovered her original size.  \\nHaving learned this lesson, our cloud remained small and modest, but she became so \\ngenerous when raining, that her new country became even greener, giving away to all \\npeople there the most beautiful rainbow in the  world.  \\nA MAD MAN IN THE CITY  \\nJulian finally left his village when there was no one left living there. He had never left his \\nbeloved village before, but intrigued by the fact that everyone had gone to the city, he \\ndecided to go and see for himself what won derful things those cities had. So he packed a \\nknapsack with a few clothes, put on his best smile, and off he went to the city.  \\nOn reaching the city, he was given a most unexpected welcome. A couple of policemen \\nstopped Julian and questioned him in great d etail. It turned out that Julian had seemed \\n\\'suspiciously happy\\' for someone with hardly any possessions. In the end, the police had to \\nlet him go, but they were still suspicious about this apparently simple and good -natured \\nfellow.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n30 \\n The first thing Julian noticed about the city was all the rushing around. Everyone was in such \\na hurry that he thought that there must be something special happening that day, which no \\none wanted to miss. Curious as to what it was, Julian started following a man who looked \\nlike he was hurrying to see whatever it was that was happening. However, after several \\nhours following him, the man arrived at a small flat and went inside. He had done or seen \\nnothing of interest that whole day.  \\nThat night Julian slept in a park. The park was strewn with bits of paper and plastic. As the \\nbins were completely empty, Julian thought how cool it was that the city had seemingly \\ninvented plants with petals made of paper and plastic. He only believed this until the \\nfollowing morning, when a man came b y and dropped his chocolate wrapper.  \\nJulian carried on walking through the city streets, trying to understand what was going on, \\nwhen he arrived at a group of big warehouses, which many people were entering. \"This \\nmust be the best museum in the world,\" he thought, on entering, and seeing all the useless -\\nlooking things they had inside. But then he saw that people were picking these things up, \\npaying for them, and taking them away.  \\n\"Why would anyone want a watch which doesn\\'t show the minutes?\" he wondered to  \\nhimself, after seeing a woman very contentedly leaving with the most modern of watches \\non her wrist. He thought pretty much the same when seeing a pair of shoes with impossibly \\nhigh heels, and then some electronic device which did a thousand things, and n one of them \\nwell. Once again, he decided to follow the lady with the watch. He saw her joy turn into \\ndisappointment when her friends gave her new watch a look of disapproval. Julian started \\nregretting having left his village, just to come to this place whe re no one seemed happy.  \\nThen he saw a few kids playing. Now, they certainly did seem happy, playing, running about, \\nchasing each other. Except for one child, who seemed troubled by a little machine they \\nwere calling a console. He was hitting it so hard wit h his fingers, and making all kinds of \\nfaces and angry gestures, that when one of the other children came over to invite him to \\nplay with them, the boy with the console just rudely walked away. Julian thought that the \\nboy was trying to destroy that little machine because it was making him so unhappy. He \\ndecided to help the boy. Julian went over, took the console, threw it on the ground, \\nstamped on it, and looked at the boy with great satisfaction.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n31 \\n At this the boy flew into a rage, as did all the other child ren there, and nearly all the adults. \\nThey pursued Julian so relentlessly that he had to run away. He didn\\'t stop running until he \\nreached the road leading back to his village.  \\nAs he was making his way home he couldn\\'t help wondering whether the whole worl d had \\ngone mad.  \\n \\nNEVER MAKE FUN OF A RHINO  \\nOnce, on the African plains, there lived a moody rhino who was very easily angered. One \\nday, a giant turtle entered the rhino\\'s territory unaware. The rhino quickly ran over to the \\nturtle, with the intention of  getting rid of it. The turtle was frightened and withdrew into its \\nshell.  \\nWhen the rhino demanded that the turtle get out of his territory, there was no discernible \\nmovement. The rhino was incredibly annoyed; he thought the turtle was fooling him. So he \\nstarted banging the shell to make the turtle come out. No success, and his blows got \\nincreasingly violent. He whacked it with his horn, sending the poor turtle flying in all \\ndirections. From a distance, it looked a bit like a solitary game of football, with  the turtle as \\nthe ball.  \\nQuite an amusing spectacle, it was, and a load of monkeys soon gathered close by to enjoy \\nit. They laughed non -stop at the angry rhino and his struggle with the turtle.  \\nThe rhino was so furious that he didn\\'t even notice that they were there. On he went, until \\nhe had to stop for a second to get his breath.  \\nNow that he wasn\\'t bashing the shell, he could hear the laughing and joking of the monkeys, \\nwho were making fun of him in every way you can imagine.  \\nNeither the rhino, nor the tur tle - who had appeared from his shell -, enjoyed the fact that a \\ngang of monkeys was mocking them.  \\nSo, they exchanged a knowing look, nodded, and the turtle went back inside his shell. This \\ntime the rhino very quietly retreated a few steps, looked at the t urtle, looked at the \\nmonkeys, took a run up, and shot the giant turtle, with such a good aim, that it seemed like \\nhe was using the monkeys as skittles.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n32 \\n The \\'strike\\' against the monkeys turned that place into something of a casualty ward for \\nbaboons. There they all lay, covered in cuts and bruises, and not even a smirk crossed their \\nlips. Meanwhile, off went the rhino and the turtle, smiling like old friends... and while the \\nmonkeys were putting on their sticking plasters, their chief realised it was about t ime they \\nfound a better way to amuse themselves than making fun of others.  \\n \\nTHE MATH DUNCE  \\nThat year, in the local school, there was a new Math teacher, as well as some new pupils. \\nOne of the new kids was the stupidest child anyone had ever seen. It mad e no difference \\nhow quickly or how slowly they tried explaining numbers to him; he would always end up \\nsaying something enormously dumb. Like two plus two was five, seven times three was \\ntwenty -seven, or a triangle had thirty corners...  \\nBefore this boy arr ived, Maths lessons had been the most boring of all. Now they were great \\nfun. Encouraged by the new teacher, the children would listen to the pieces of nonsense \\nspouted by the new kid, and they would have to correct his mistakes.  \\nThey all wanted to be the first to find his mistakes, and then think up the most original ways \\nto explain them. To do this they used all kinds of stuff: sweets, playing cards, oranges, paper \\nplanes...  \\nIt didn\\'t seem like any of this bothered the new kid.  \\nHowever, little Lewis was s ure that it was bound to make him feel sad inside.  \\nSo, one day, he decided to follow the new kid home after school; Lewis was sure he would \\nsee him crying.  \\nOn leaving school, the new kid walked a few minutes to a local park, and there he waited for \\na while , until someone came along to meet him...  \\nIt was the new teacher!  \\nThe teacher gave the new kid a hug, and off they went, hand in hand. Following from a \\ndistance, Lewis could hear they were talking about Math.  \\nAnd that stupid new kid knew everything about i t, much more than anyone in the class!   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n33 \\n THE WHITE ROSE  \\nIn a garden filled with bushes, out from between a load of grass and weeds, there appeared, \\nas if from nowhere, a white rose. It was as white as driven snow, its petals looked like \\nvelvet, and the morni ng dew shone from its leaves like resplendent crystals. The flower \\ncouldn’t see herself, so she had no idea how pretty she was. And so it was that she spent \\nthe few days of her life, until wilting set on, without knowing that all around her were \\namazed by her and her perfection: her perfume, the softness of her petals, her elegance. \\nShe didn’t realise that everyone who saw her spoke well of her. The weeds that surrounded \\nher were fascinated by her beauty, and lived in a state of enchantment at her aroma and  \\nappearance.  \\nOne hot, sunny day, a girl was strolling through the garden, thinking about how many lovely \\nthings Mother Nature has given us, when she suddenly saw a white rose in a forgotten part \\nof the garden. The rose was beginning to fade and wilt.  \\n-“It’s days since it rained,”  \\nshe thought,  \\n-“if the rose stays here till tomorrow it\\'ll be totally withered. I’ll take it home and put it in \\nthe lovely vase I got as a present.”  \\nAnd so she did. With all her love she put the wilting white rose in water, inside a  lovely \\ncolourful glass vase, and placed it by the window.  \\n-\"I\\'ll put it here,\"  \\nshe thought,  \\n-\"so the flower can get some sun.\"  \\nWhat the young girl didn’t realise was that the reflection from the window meant that, for \\nthe first time, the rose got to see h erself and what she looked like.  \\n-“Is that me?”  \\nthought the rose. Little by little her drooping leaves began to rise, once again stretching up \\ntowards the sun, and, gradually, the rose recovered her former appearance. When she was  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n34 \\n totally back to her best she looked at her reflection and saw that she was indeed a beautiful \\nflower. She thought  \\n-\"Wow! Till now I hadn’t realised who I was, how could I have been so blind?”  \\nThe rose came to realise she had spent her days without appreciating her beauty, unable t o \\nsee herself, unable to know who she really was.  \\nIf you really want to know who you are, forget everything that’s around you, and just look \\ninto your heart.  \\n \\nTHE RUBY THIEF  \\nIn the palace of Rubyland there was a ruby thief. No one knew who it was, and the thief had \\neveryone so fooled that the only thing known about him was that he lived in the palace, and \\nthat when you were in the palace you should always hide your jewels.  \\nThe King decided to find out who it was, and he asked for help from a wise dwarf who was \\nfamed for his intelligence. The dwarf spent some days there, watching and listening, until \\ntheir was another theft. The following morning the wise dwarf made all the palace \\ninhabitants meet up together in the same room. After inspecting them for th e whole \\nmorning, and during lunch, without saying a word, the dwarf started asking them all, one by \\none, what they knew about the stolen jewels.  \\nOnce again, it seemed that no one had been the thief. But then, suddenly, one of the \\ngardeners began coughing, writhing and moaning, and finally he fell to the floor.  \\nThe dwarf, with a cheeky smile, explained that the food they had just eaten was poisoned, \\nand the only antidote for this poison was hidden inside the ruby that had been stolen the \\nprevious night. And he explained how, some days earlier, he himself had swapped some \\nfalse rubies for the genuine ones, and that he expected that only the thief would be able to \\nsave his life, since the poison was particularly quick working…  \\nThe coughs and groans spread aroun d the room, and terror took hold of all present. All \\nexcept one person. A footman didn’t take long to run over to where he had hidden the \\njewels, from where he took the final ruby. Fortunately he would be able to open it and drink \\nthe strange liquid inside , thus saving his life.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n35 \\n Or so he believed, because the gardener was, in fact, one of the dwarf’s assistants, and the \\npoison was nothing more than a potion prepared by the little investigator to cause a few \\nstrong pains for a short while, but nothing more t han that. And the footman, now found \\nout, was arrested by the guards and taken immediately to court.  \\nThe King, grateful, generously rewarded his wise adviser, and when he asked the dwarf \\nwhat his secret was, the dwarf smiled and said:  \\n-“I only try to get t he person knowing the truth to reveal that truth.”  \\n-“And who knew it? If the thief had deceived everyone…  \\n-“No, your majesty, not everyone. Anyone can deceive everyone, but no one can deceive \\nthemselves.”  \\n \\nTHE DRAWING THAT TALKED  \\nPinty Tailor was a little boy who enjoyed going to school and doing all sorts of things, except \\nfor art and writing. Using brushes and pencils did not come easy to Pinty, so his works of art \\ndid not end happily, and he would just give up in disgust.  \\nBut one day Pinty found a pencil  of such lovely colours that he could not resist, and he tried \\ndrawing a circle. As ever, it did not go well, and he was about to throw the pencil away \\nwhen his drawing began to speak to him.  \\n‘Psst! You aren’t going to leave me like this, are you? Come on,  the least you can do is draw \\nme a pair of eyes!’ said the drawing. Pinty was understandably shocked, but he managed to \\ndraw two little spots inside the circle.  \\n‘Much better, now I can see myself,’ said the circle, looking around at itself… ‘Arghh! But \\nwha t have you done to me?!’  \\n‘I don’t draw very well,’ said Pinty, trying to make excuses.  \\n‘OK, no problem,’ the drawing interrupted him, ‘I’m sure that if you try again you’ll do \\nbetter. Go on, rub me out!’ So Pinty erased the circle and drew another one. Lik e the first \\none, it was not very round.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n36 \\n ‘Hey! You forgot the eyes again!’  \\n‘Oh, yeah.’  \\n‘Hmmm, I think I’m going to have to teach you how to draw until you can do me well,’ said \\nthe circle with its quick, squeaky little voice.  \\nTo Pinty, who remained almost p aralysed with shock, this did not seem like a bad idea, and \\nhe immediately found himself drawing and erasing circles. The circle would not stop saying \\n‘rub this out, but carefully; it hurts,’ or ‘draw me some hair, quickly, I look like a lollipop!’ \\nand oth er funny remarks.  \\nAfter spending nearly the whole afternoon together, Pinty could already draw the little \\nfigure much better than most of his classmates could have. He was enjoying it so much that \\nhe did not want to stop drawing with this crazy new teacher  of his. Before going to bed that \\nnight, Pinty gave his new instructor a hearty thank you for having taught him how to draw \\nso well.  \\n‘But I didn’t do anything, silly!’ answered the little drawing, in its usual quick manner.  \\n‘Don’t you see that you’ve been practicing a lot, and enjoying it all the while? I bet that’s the \\nfirst time you’ve done that!’  \\nPinty stopped to think. The truth was that previously, he had drawn so badly because he \\nhad never practiced more than ten minutes at a time, and he had always d one it angrily and \\ngrudgingly. Without doubt, what the little drawing had said was correct.  \\n‘OK, you’re right, but thank you anyway,’ said Pinty, and before he went to bed he carefully \\nplaced the pencil in his school bag.  \\nThe next morning Pinty jumped out of bed and went running to find his pencil, but it was \\nnot there. He searched everywhere, but there was no sign of it. And the sheet of paper on \\nwhich he had drawn the little figure, although still full of rubbing out marks, was completely \\nblank. Pinty beg an to worry, and he did not know if he had really spent the previous \\nafternoon talking with the little man or whether he had dreamt the whole thing.  \\nSo, to try to settle the matter, he took a pencil and some paper and tried to draw a little \\nman.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n37 \\n It turned out not bad at all, except for a couple of jagged lines. He imagined his bossy little \\nteacher telling him to round out those edges, and that it looked like he was trying to give \\nhim spots. Pinty gladly rubbed out those bits and redrew them. He realised tha t the crazy \\nlittle teacher had been right: it made no difference whether you had the magic pencil or not; \\nto manage to do things, you only needed to keep trying and to enjoy doing so.  \\nFrom that day on, whenever Pinty tried to draw or paint, or do anything else, he always had \\nfun imagining the result of his work protesting to him and saying ‘Come on, my friend, do \\nme a bit better than that! I can’t go to the party looking like this!’  \\nTHE SINGING HIPPO  \\nOnce upon a time, a hippopotamus lived in a river next to  a big and solitary tree.  \\nOne day, a bird came and nested in the tree. The songs and the flight of the bird caused \\nsuch envy in the hippo that he couldn\\'t think of anything else. Every day he would lament \\nthe fact that he had been born a hippo. This, despi te the many times the bird told the hippo \\nhe was so lucky to be so big and such a good swimmer.  \\nFinally, the hippo made his mind up that he would come out of the river, climb the tree, go \\nout to perch on a branch, and start singing. However, when he tried to climb the tree it was \\nall too clear that the hippo didn\\'t have wings, nor claws to climb with, and neither could he \\nhop.  \\nRealising that he would never manage it, he angrily rammed his whole weight against the \\ntree until it came crashing to the ground. T hen, triumphantly, he stepped onto the leaves of \\nthe fallen tree, and began singing.  \\nUnfortunately, hippos can\\'t sing either. All that came from his mouth were horrible noises, \\nand when the other animals heard this they all gathered round to make fun of th e hippo \\nstanding on the branch of a fallen tree, trying to sing like a bird.  \\nHe was so embarrassed by this that he decided to never again regret being a hippo. He also \\nfelt bad about having knocked the tree over. He used all his strength to raise the tree back \\nup again, replant it, and look after it until it had completely recovered.  \\n  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n38 \\n THE INCREDIBLE BLACK RAIN  \\nGus Grumplings was never happy with anything. He had lots of friends, and parents who \\nloved him dearly, but all Gus could think about was what he did n\\'t have, or things he did \\nhave which he was unhappy with. If someone gave him a car, it would be too big or too \\nslow. If he went to the zoo, he\\'d come back disappointed because they hadn\\'t let him feed \\nthe lions. If he played football with his friends, he  would complain, saying there were too \\nmany of them for just one ball...  \\nWhat caught Gus unawares was Chuckles the prankster cloud. One day, Chuckles was \\ndrifting past, and heard all of Gus\\'s complaining. Chuckles wafted over to see. When the \\ncloud was rig ht above Gus, he started dropping heavy black rain on him. That was Chuckles\\' \\nfavourite trick to play on grumpy little kids.  \\nGus wasn\\'t at all impressed by this new development; it just made him complain even more. \\nHe was even angrier after he realised tha t the cloud was following him.  \\nWell, this carried on for almost a week. Gus couldn\\'t get away from the cloud, and he got \\nmore and more infuriated.  \\nGus had a little friend, a happy and generous girl called Gladys. Gladys was the only one who \\nhad been willin g to hang around with Gus during all those black, rainy days. All the other \\nchildren had run off to avoid getting soaked and ending up completely black.  \\nOne day, when Gus was at the end of his tether, she said to him: \"Cheer up! What you \\nshould realise is that you\\'re the only one of us who has his very own cloud, and even better, \\nits rain is black! We could play some fun games with a cloud like this, don\\'t you reckon?\" As \\nGladys was his only company these days, and he didn\\'t want her to leave as the others had, \\nGus reluctantly agreed.  \\nGladys took him to the swimming pool, and left him there until all the pool water was black. \\nThen she went and got other kids. They came and played in the pool. The water being black \\nmeant they could play hide and seek! Grudgin gly, Gus had to admit it had been a lot of fun, \\nbut what was even more fun was playing Wet the Cat.  \\nGus would find cats and run alongside them. When the cats felt themselves getting wet they \\nwould jump about in the craziest way, and run off at top speed, w ith funny looks on their  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n39 \\n faces. Before long, all the children in town had gathered around Gus, thinking up new games \\nthey could play using the cloud.  \\nFor the first time ever, Gus started to see the positive side of things; even things which, at \\nfirst, had seemed so bad. Chuckles, the prankster cloud, thought that he could now leave; \\nhis work had been done. But, before leaving, he gave Gus two days of multicoloured rain, \\nwith which the children invented the most fun games ever.  \\nWhen Chuckles finally left, Gu s didn\\'t complain. Now he knew to focus on the good in life, \\nand the good thing about Chuckles\\' departure was that no longer was Gus soaking wet all \\nday. Now he could go and do dry things, and that\\'s exactly what he did.  \\nMY LITTLE WORLD HAS BROKEN  \\nOnce upo n a time there was a spring who lived happily and safely inside a pen. Although he \\nheard many noises coming from outside, he lived believing that outside his world inside the \\npen, there was nothing good. Even just to think about leaving his pen made him so  scared \\nthat he was quite content to spend his life compacting and stretching himself again and \\nagain inside that tiny space.  \\nHowever, one day, the ink ran out, and when the pen\\'s owner was busy changing it, there \\nwas an accident. The spring was flung thro ugh the air and landed in the toilet drain, well out \\nof sight. Terrified, and cursing his bad luck, the spring was flushed through pipe after pipe, \\neach time thinking it might be his end. During the journey, he did not dare open his eyes out \\nof pure fear. Nor did he every stop crying. Swept away by the water, he travelled on and on \\nand on, until he ended up in a river. When the river current lost its force, and the spring \\ncould see that things had calmed down a bit, he stopped crying and listened all around  him. \\nHearing birdsong and wind in the trees, he felt encouraged to finally open his eyes. What \\nthe spring saw was the pure, crystal waters of the river, the rich green rocks of the riverbed, \\nand all kinds of fish of many colours, whose skin seemed to danc e under the sunlight. Now \\nhe understood that the world was much greater than the space inside the pen, and that \\nthere had always been many things outside, waiting to be enjoyed.  \\nAfter spending a while playing with the fish, he went over to the riverbank, a nd then moved \\non to a field of flowers. There he heard weeping. He followed the sound, which took him to \\na lovely flower that had been flattened by a rabbit, and could no longer stand up straight. \\nThe spring realised that he could help the flower, so he of fered to be his support. The flower  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n40 \\n accepted, and slipped through the middle of the spring. There they lived happily together. \\nAnd they would always laugh when remembering how the spring used to think that all there \\nwas to life was being a sad and fearful spring.  \\nTHE UNFRIENDLY RIVER  \\nOnce upon a time there was a river. This river was rather unfriendly and lonesome. The river \\ncould not remember how long ago he had decided that he no longer wanted to put up with \\nanything or anyone. He lived alone, refusing to  share his water with any fish, plant or \\nanimal.  \\nAnd so his life went on, sadly and filled with loneliness, for many centuries.  \\nOne day, a little girl with a goldfish bowl came to the bank of this river. In the bowl lived \\nScamp, her favourite little fish. The girl was about to move to another country, and she \\nwouldn\\'t be able to take Scamp with her. So she had decided to give Scamp his freedom.  \\nWhen Scamp fell into the river, he immediately felt the river\\'s loneliness. Scamp tried talking \\nto the river, but the river told Scamp to go away. Now, Scamp was a very happy little fish, \\nand he wasn\\'t going to give up so easily. He asked and asked, swam and swam, and finally \\nhe started jumping in and out of the water.  \\nThe river, feeling all the jumping and splashing,  started to laugh. It tickled!  \\nAfter a while, this put the river in such a good mood that he started talking to Scamp. \\nAlmost without knowing it, by the end of that day, Scamp and the river had become very \\ngood friends.  \\nThe river spent that night thinking about how much fun it was to have friends, and how \\nmuch he had missed by not having them. He asked himself why he had never had them, but \\nhe couldn\\'t remember.  \\nThe next morning, Scamp woke the river with a few playful splashes... and that was when \\nthe rive r remembered why he had decided to be such an unfriendly river:  \\nHe remembered that he was very ticklish, and that he wouldn\\'t have been able to stand it! \\nNow he remembered perfectly how he had told everyone to scoot, that he wasn\\'t going to \\nput up with all  that tickling.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n41 \\n But, remembering how sad and lonely he had felt for so many years, the river realised that \\nalthough it may sometimes be a bit inconvenient or uncomfortable, it was always better to \\nhave friends and to try to be happy.  \\nTHE TICKLING SCALES  \\nOne day, in the jungle, a set of bathroom scales appeared. The animals played with it for \\nquite some time until a parrot who had escaped from the zoo explained to them how it \\nworked. All the animals took turns to weigh themselves. At first this was a big game; every \\nday each animal would see how much weight they had gained or lost. However, before long, \\nmany animals began to obsess about their weight. The first thing they would do each day \\nwould be to run to the scales, weigh themselves, and spend the rest  of the day with a \\ngrumpy expression on their faces. This because, no matter what the scales said, the animals \\nalways weighed the same, in other words: \"more than they wanted to\".  \\nAs the months passed, the scales began to suffer the animals’ disapproval. T he scales were \\nregularly kicked, or given poisonous looks. One day, the scales decided that from the \\nfollowing morning things would have to change.  \\nThat morning, the first to run to weigh itself was the zebra. However, as soon as it stepped \\nonto the scales , the scales began tickling the zebra’s hooves. Soon the scales found just the \\nright spot, and the zebra couldn’t stop giggling. This was so much fun for the zebra that from \\nthat day on it no longer worried about its weight, and off it went to happily eat its breakfast \\nfor the first time in ages. The same happened to whoever went to weigh themselves that \\nday... so that, before long, no one was worried any longer about their weight. Rather, they \\nall commented on how much fun the scales and its tickling were.  \\nAs the months and the years passed, the scales stopped reading weight and began reading \\ngood humour and optimism instead. Soon everyone happily discovered that this was a much \\nbetter indicator of beauty and a person’s value. Finally, in the jungle everyon e forgot about \\nthat antiquated and old -fashioned measurement known as the kilo.  \\nA DAY WITH PIGS  \\nThere was once a boy who would never get dressed when his parents told him to, nor would \\nhe put on what they wanted him to after his bath. He preferred to dress  in a much stranger \\nmanner, but above all, he liked to take his time. His parents were always in a rush, and  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n42 \\n wanted him to be a lot quicker, but the boy didn\\'t like this, and he would slow down even \\nmore.  \\nOne day, his parents were in their usual hurry, and  they got so angry when he refused to \\ndress, that they told him that he would have to go out naked. The boy didn\\'t mind this in the \\nleast. So out they went.  \\nWhile the boy was standing naked outside his house, waiting for his parents to bring the car, \\nalong  came the local pig farmer. The pig farmer was hard of hearing and had poor eyesight. \\nNot only that, but he\\'d also forgotten to put his glasses on that day. When he saw the little \\nboy\\'s pink skin, he thought it was one of his pigs. And, with a bit of shout ing, prodding, and \\npushing, the farmer managed to get the boy safely back to a pigsty.  \\nThe boy protested the whole way there, but as the farmer was almost deaf, his complaints \\ndidn\\'t help him. And there he was for the whole day, living amongst the pigs, th ought to be \\na pig, and sharing their food and home.  \\nFinally, though, his parents found him. The boy had had such a regrettable day that never \\nagain did he want to be mistaken for anything other than a human being. Nowadays he\\'s \\nthe first to get dressed, an d look perfectly neat and tidy, just like those children in the \\nclothes catalogues  \\nTHE WARM WHALE  \\nGail the Whale lived in a small salty lake. She was the only whale in that territory, and she \\nled a very comfortable life. In fact, this easy life made her a bit fussy. But, one year, there \\nwas such an incredibly hot summer that the lake\\'s water really warmed up. Gail, used to \\nsuch an ideal existence, could hardly stand the hot water. A little fish, which had spent some \\ntime in a child\\'s goldfish bowl, told Gai l that humans used fans to cool themselves down in \\nsummer. From then on, Gail the Whale couldn\\'t think of anything else apart from how to \\nbuild her very own fan.  \\nEveryone told her that she was overreacting, and that the hot weather would soon pass, but \\nGail got to work, constructing her enormous fan. When it was finally finished, she started \\nfanning away at herself.   \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n43 \\n Unlucky for the fish!  The giant fan beat the little lake\\'s waters so strongly that huge waves \\nrolled right across it. The waves crashed onto th e lakeshore, leaving the lake half empty, and \\nGail stranded in only a few inches of water.  \\n\"You couldn\\'t just hang on for while. You had to empty the lake,\" some unhappy -looking fish \\nberated her.  \"So impatient! So selfish!\" others shouted. But the worst of  it for Gail was not \\nthe insults, but the fact that with so little water around her, the heat was becoming \\nunbearable. Preparing herself to die of heatstroke, she said her goodbyes to all her friends, \\nand they asked for her forgiveness. She assured them al l that if she were to live again she \\nwould be stronger and learn to put up with life\\'s discomforts.  \\nYet, once again, Gail the Whale was overreacting. She managed to survive those hot days \\nwithout dying, although, of course, she suffered. When the next rain s arrived, the lake filled \\nup again, and the weather improved. Naturally, Gail had to keep her promise, and show \\neveryone that she had learned not to be so dependent on comfort, so impatient, and so \\nfussy.  \\nTHE MAGIC WINDOW  \\nOnce upon a time there was a litt le boy who became very ill. He had to spend all day in bed, \\nunable to move. Because other children weren\\'t allowed to come near him, he suffered \\ngreatly, and spent  his days feeling sad and blue.  \\nThere wasn\\'t much he could do except look out of the window. Time passed, and his feeling \\nof despair just grew. Until one day he saw a strange shape in the window. It was a penguin \\neating a sausage sandwich. The penguin squeezed in through the open window, said \"good \\nafternoon\" to the boy,  turned around, and left ag ain. \\nOf course, the boy was very surprised. He was still trying to work out what had happened, \\nwhen outside his window he saw a monkey in a nappy, busy blowing up a balloon. At first \\nthe boy asked himself what that could possibly be, but after a while, as more and more \\ncrazy -looking characters appeared out the window, he burst out laug hing and found it hard \\nto stop.  \\nAnyone wanting to stop laughing would never be helped by seeing a pig playing a \\ntambourine, an elephant jumping on a trampoline, or a dog weari ng a pair of glasses and \\ntalking about nothing except politics. The little boy didn\\'t tell anyone about this because \\nwho would have believed him? Even so, those strange characters ended up putting joy back  \\n \\nSpoken English: Short Stories  \\n44 \\n in his heart, and in his body. Before long, his he alth had improved so much that he was able \\nto go back to school again.  \\nThere he got to talk to his friends, and tell them all the strange things he had seen. While he \\nwas talking to his best friend he saw something sticking out of his friend\\'s school bag. The \\nboy asked his friend what it was, and he was so insistent that finally his friend had to show \\nhim what was in the bag:  \\nThere, inside, were all the fancy -dress suits and disguises that his best friend had been using \\nto try to cheer the little boy up!  \\nAnd from that day on, the little boy always did his best to make sure that no one felt sad \\nand alone.']\n",

Nevertheless, the little girl brought the \\ngift to her father the next morning and said, “This is for you, Daddy.”The man w as \\nembarrassed by his earlier overreaction, but his anger flared again when he found out the \\nbox was empty. He yelled at her, stating, “Don’t you know, when you give someone a \\npresent, there is supposed to be something inside? The little girl looked up at him with tears \\nin her eyes and cried, “Oh, Daddy, it’s not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They’re all \\nfor you, Daddy.”The father was crushed.
